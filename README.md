# Problem description

This project was created on Feb-7-2023 using the typescript create-react-app template. I added one short file - `experiment.tsx`.

My component compiles fine. But if I try to use it using JSX syntax I get a syntax error. If I use it as a function it compiles fine. Why the difference? How can I use my component using JSX syntax?
